# HackerRank

This repository contains my submissions to https://www.hackerrank.com/shilpikats5991.

I started solving problems on Hacker Rank as a way to get into Functional Programming so most solutions you will find here are written in Scala.

Classes that end in Best are used to store a solution I found particularly elegant.
Happy reading, and solve your own challenges first before peaking here ;)
